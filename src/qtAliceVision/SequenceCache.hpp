/**
 * @brief Image server with a caching system for loading image sequences from disk.
 *
 * Given a sequence of images (ordered by filename), the SequenceCache works as an image server:
 * it receives requests from clients (in the form of a filepath)
 * and its purpose is to provide the corresponding images (if they exist in the sequence).
 *
 * The SequenceCache takes advantage of the ordering of the sequence to load whole "regions" at once
 * (a region being a contiguous range of images from the sequence).
 * Such strategy makes sense under the assumption that the sequence order is meaningful for clients,
 * i.e. that if an image is queried then it is likely that the next queries will be close in the sequence.
